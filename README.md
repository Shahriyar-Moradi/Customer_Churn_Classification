# RayanKar_Python_Developer_AI_Task
This Task is about Telco Customer Churn. Customer churn is the percentage of customers who stopped purchasing your business's products or services during a certain period of time. Your customer churn rate indicates how many of your existing customers are not likely to make another purchase from your business.

In this project, I started with data Processing and the clean-up of data to gain a more efficient model. I decided to select the Churn feature as my target variable to figure out the behavior of customers. I found 11 missing data in the TotalCharges column that fixed it, then I chose the LogisticRegression model which is very helpful for classification problems. I trained and evaluated the model and gained 80% accuracy whic is more than 75% for my classification model. Next, I visualize the representation of my model's performance including the ROC curve, and confusion matrix.

After all, I improved The Test you mentioned and I wrote my own test with Pytest.

Finally, I provided Jupiter notebook named main.ipynb to figure out step by step the procedure to approach my goal.

You Can Run Python main.py to run the whole process or run main.ipynb step by step.

Run python3 -m unittest test_model.py and pytest test_model2.py
